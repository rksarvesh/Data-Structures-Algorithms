This folder contains a simple Implementation of a graph. It also includes the implementation of Kruksals minimum spanning tree algorithm
which is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. 
It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs 
at each step. An example of the a sample graph adjacency list is also present in the folder.
